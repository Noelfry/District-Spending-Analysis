# District-Spending-Analysis

In this notebook we will be exploring the research question : How much of an impact does educational spending have on a student's quality of education?

To answer this question we will be using a dataset pulled from School Finance Indicator Database, with information on spending, performance and demographics from over 12,000+ different schools districts grades K-12. We will looking at spending and how a districts level of spending affects its student's test performance. We will be diving into whether demographics play a role in how well funded a district is. Lastly we will be comparing states in order to determine whether they have similar rates of high-need students and what kind of repercussion or lack of, this may hold. Lets dive in!
